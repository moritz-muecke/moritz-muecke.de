## Usages

My website is build with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

As I'm not the design kind of guy I used the starter template [Gatsby Simplefolio Theme](https://github.com/cobidev/gatsby-simplefolio) provided by [Jacobo Mart√≠nez](https://github.com/cobidev). I made some adjustments so that the template fits my needs.

The cool illustrations are provided by [unDraw](https://undraw.co/illustrations). It's a gigantic library for free illustrations.
